<h1>A Two Stage Classifier for DGA Detection</h1>


<div class="abstract">
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nowadays, criminals try to exploit vulnerabilities in various devices using malware. For attacks using malware to be successful, it is necessary to establish a C&C channel (command and control) in order to have communication between the controlled machine and the C&C server. In order to avoid blacklisting and detection, some types of malware started using DGAâ€™s (Domain Generation Algorithms) to generate multiple domain names, making it costly to discover and block all generated names.

Recently, new forms of domain name abuse have been created, as well as new detection strategies. Many of these strategies involve machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms, based on neural networks. These strategies with neural networks are characterized by being generators or detectors that focus on creating or detecting specific DGA families. The motivation of this thesis comes from the fact that many of these strategies are not prepared to be retrained or adjusted to new DGA families that might come up. One may retrain the same neural network from scratch, but this could take days or even weeks to do so, due to the amount of data needed. The main objective of this thesis is the development of a DGA classification model, which, in contrast to other tools already developed, is more flexible and more robust.<p>
